# Amazon_Vine_Analysis

## Overview 
I will be taking Amazon reviews on shoes and analyzing the paid vs non paid vine members to assess bias based on payment for reviews.

In order to do this, I constructed data tables that filtered out my customers, products, reviews, and vine account status.![Customer's_Table](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/97993428/173238704-5751dbc0-07b4-4ac6-b655-7dfab4b760f5.png)

![Products Table](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/97993428/173238766-a28a0f07-50c5-40a2-bc7b-de0e5b99efe1.png)

I then used that information to further filter those tables further to get the paid and non paid vine accounts that met our needs for the analysis.

## Results: 

There were 22 total paid Vine reviews while there were 26987 total non-paid Vine reviews.

There were 13 total paid Vine 5 star reviews while there were 14475 total non-paid Vine 5 star reviews.

Approximately 54% of paid Vine reviews were 5 stars while approximately 59% of non paid Vine reviews were 5 stars.

## Summary: 

The percentages do not reflect a positivity bias in the paid reviews.  In fact, the non paid Vine accounts gave 5 stars at a higher percentage than the paid accounts.  There are numerous tests I would do to continue testing bias.  I would determine the average ratings of both sets of accounts, because I do not think that 5 stars are the only rating that determine bias.  The lack of giving a 1 start review is also telling information to have when determining bias.
